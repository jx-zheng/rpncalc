# rpncalc

A Reverse Polish Notation calculator written in Python. Reverse Polish Notation calculators are unique in that instead of using infix notation for operations (5 + 5), postfix is used (5 5 +) by using the properties of a stack data structure. This eliminates the need for parentheses, and calculations can therefore be performed faster on an RPN calculator than a traditional infix calculator. This project was inspired by traditional HP calculators, which used postfix notation and was a favourite of many engineers.
